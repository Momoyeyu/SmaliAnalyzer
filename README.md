# SmaliAnalyzer

**Yet another Smali to Java decompiler (or translator), written in Java.**

SmaliAnalyzer is an ongoing development project designed to analyze Smali instructions that traditional decompilers like JADX might struggle with, potentially resulting in `JADX WARN` and `JADX ERROR` messages. Our goal is to provide a robust alternative for handling complex Smali code.

### Current Status

The project is in active development. While we are working towards advanced features, our immediate focus is on establishing a solid foundation by delivering basic analysis capabilities comparable to those offered by JADX.

### Objective

Our primary objective is to ensure that SmaliAnalyzer can effectively decompile Smali code, addressing the challenges that existing tools cannot. We aim to provide a reliable tool for developers working with Android reverse engineering and bytecode analysis.

### Roadmap

1. **Basic Analysis**: Achieve parity with existing decompilers in terms of basic analysis capabilities.
2. **Advanced Features**: Once the basics are solidified, we will explore and implement advanced decompilation techniques to handle more complex scenarios.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have ideas, bug reports, or would like to collaborate, please get in touch.

### License

**[License Information Will Be Added Later]**

As the project is still in its infancy, we are open to suggestions and discussions about the licensing. We will update the license information once a decision is made.

Feel free to use SmaliAnalyzer for your projects, and we look forward to your feedback and support.
